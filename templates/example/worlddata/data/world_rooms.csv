room_01,Intro,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"{gWelcome to the Evennia tutorial!{n

The following tutorial consists of a small single-player quest area. The various rooms are designed to show off some of the power and possibilities of the Evennia mud creation system. At any time during this tutorial you can use the {wtutorial{n (or {wtut{n) command to get some background info about the room or certain objects to see what is going on ""behind the scenes"".

 To get into the mood of this miniature quest, imagine you are an adventurer out to find fame and fortune. You have heard rumours of an old castle ruin by the coast. In its depth a warrior princess was buried together with her powerful magical weapon - a valuable prize, if it's true.  Of course this is a chance to adventure that you cannot turn down!

 You reach the coast in the midst of a raging thunderstorm. With wind and rain screaming in your face you stand where the moor meet the sea along a high, rocky coast ...

room_02,Leaving Tutorial,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,You are quitting the Evennia tutorial prematurely! Please come back later.,
room_03,Cliff by the coast,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"You stand on the high coast line overlooking a stormy {wsea{n far below. Around you the ground is covered in low gray-green grass, pushed flat by wind and rain. Inland, the vast dark moors begin, only here and there covered in patches of low trees and brushes.

 To the east, you glimpse the ragged outline of a castle {wruin{n. It sits perched on a sheer cliff out into the water, isolated from the
 shore. The only way to reach it seems by way of an old hanging bridge, anchored not far east from here.",
room_04,Outside Evennia Inn,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"You stand outside a one-story sturdy wooden building. Light flickers behind closed storm shutters. Over the door a sign creaks in the wind - the writing says {cEvennia Inn{n and the curly letters are surrounded by a painted image of some sort of snake.  From inside you hear the sound of laughter, singing and loud conversation.",
room_05,The Evennia Inn,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"The Evennia Inn consists of one large room filled with tables. The bardisk extends along the east wall, where multiple barrels and bottles line the shelves. The barkeep seems busy handing out ale and chatting with the patrons, which are a rowdy and cheerful lot, keeping the sound level only just below thunderous. This is a rare spot of warmth and mirth on this dread moor.

 Soon you have a beer in hand and are chatting with the locals. Your eye falls on a {wbarrel{n in a corner with a few old rusty weapons sticking out. There is a sign next to it: {wFree to take{n. A patron tells you cheerfully that it's the leftovers from those foolish adventurers that challenged the old ruin before you ...

 (to get a weapon from the barrel, use {wget weapon{n)",
room_06,The old bridge,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,,
room_07,Protruding ledge,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"You are on a narrow ledge protruding from the side of the cliff, about halfway down.  The air is saturated with salty sea water, sprays hitting your face from the crashing waves {wbelow{n.

 The ledge is covered with a few black-grey brushes. Not far from you the cliff-face is broken down to reveal a narrow natural opening into the cliff. High above you the {wbridge{n sways and creaks in the wind.",
room_08,Underground passages,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"The underground cavern system you have entered seems to stretch on forever, with criss-crossing paths and natural caverns probably carved by water. It is not completely dark, here and there faint daylight sifts down from above - the cliff is porous leaving channels of air and light up to the surface.

 (some time later)

 You eventually come upon a cavern with a black pool of stale water. In it sits a murky bucket, the first remnant of any sort of intelligent life down here. The bucket has disconnected from a chain hanging down from a circular opening high above. Gray daylight simmers down the hole together with rain that ripples the black surface of the pool.",
room_09,Dark cell,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"{YThe {yflickering light{Y of your makeshift light reveals a small square cell. It does not seem like you are still in the castle, for the stone of the walls are chiseled crudely and drip with water and mold.

One wall holds a solid iron-cast door. While rusted and covered with lichen it seems very sturdy. In a corner lies what might have once been a bed or a bench but is now nothing more than a pile of splinters, one of which you are using for light. One of the walls is covered with a thick cover of black roots having broken through the cracks from the outside.{n",
room_10,Ruined gatehouse,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"The old gatehouse is near collapse. Part of its northern wall has already fallen down, together with parts of the fortifications in that direction.  Heavy stone pillars hold up sections of ceiling, but elsewhere the flagstones are exposed to open sky. Part of a heavy portcullis, formerly blocking off the inner castle from attack, is sprawled over the ground together with most of its frame.

 {wEast{n the gatehouse leads out to a small open area surrounded by the remains of the castle.  There is also a standing archway offering passage to a path along the old {wsouth{nern inner wall.",
room_11,Along inner wall,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"What appears at first sight to be a series of connected rooms actually turns out to be collapsed buildings so mashed together by the ravages of time that they all seem to lean on each other and against the outer wall. The whole scene is directly open to the sky.

The buildings make a half-circle along the main wall, here and there broken by falling stone and rubble. At one end (the {wnorth{nern) of this half-circle is the entrance to the castle, the ruined gatehoue. {wEast{nwards from here is some sort of open courtyard.",
room_12,Corner of castle ruins,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"The ruins opens up to the sky in a small open area, lined by columns. The open area is dominated by a huge stone {wobelisk{n in its center, an ancient ornament miraculously still standing.

Previously one could probably continue past the obelisk and eastward into the castle keep itself, but that way is now completely blocked by fallen rubble. To the {wwest{n is the gatehouse and entrance to the castle, whereas {wsouth{nwards the collumns make way for a wide open courtyard.",
room_13,Overgrown courtyard,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"The inner courtyard of the old castle is littered with debris and overgrown with low grass and patches of thorny vines. There is a collapsed structure close to the gatehouse that looks like a stable.

{wNorth{nwards is a smaller area cornered in the debris, adorned with a large obelisk-like thing. To the {wwest{n the castle walls loom over a mess of collapsed buildings. On the opposite, {weast{nern side of the yard is a large building with a curved roof that seem to have withstood the test of time better than many of those around it, it looks like some sort of temple.",
room_14,The ruined temple,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"This building seems to have survived the ravages of time better than most of the others. Its arched roof and wide spaces suggests that this is a temple or church of some kind.

The wide hall of the temple stretches before you. At the far edge is a stone altar with no clear markings. Despite its relatively good condition, the temple is empty of all furniture or valuables, like it was looted or its treasures moved ages ago.

Stairs lead down to the temple's dungeon on either side of the altar. A gaping door opening shows the a wide courtyard to the west.",
room_15,Antechamber,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"This chamber lies almost directly under the main altar of the temple. The passage of aeons is felt here and you also sense you are close to great power.

The sides of the chamber are lined with stone archways, these are entrances to the {wtombs{n of what must have been influential families or individual heroes of the realm. Each is adorned by a stone statue or symbol of fine make. They do not seem to be ordered in any particular order or rank.",
room_16,Blue bird tomb,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,,
room_17,Tomb of woman on horse,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,,
room_18,Tomb of the crowned queen,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,,
room_19,Tomb of the shield,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,,
room_20,Tomb of the hero,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,,
room_21,Ancient tomb,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"Apart from the ornate sarcophagus, the tomb is bare from extra decorations. This is the resting place of a warrior with little patience for glamour and trinkets. You have reached the end of your quest.",
room_22,End of tutorial,,typeclasses.rooms.Room,"{gThanks for trying out this little Evennia tutorial!

The game play given here is of course just scraping the surface of what can be done with Evennia. The tutorial focuses more on showing various techniques than to supply any sort of novel storytelling or gaming challenge. The full README and source code for the tutorial world can be found under {wcontrib/tutorial_world{g.

If you went through the tutorial quest once, it can be interesting to do it again to explore the various possibilities and rooms you might not have come across yet, maybe with the source/build code next to you.  If you play as superuser (user #1) the mobile will ignore you and teleport rooms etc will not affect you (this will also disable all locks, so keep that in mind when checking functionality).{n",
